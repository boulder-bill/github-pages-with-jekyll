 I am learning to code and program again after 10 years sine my last programming class in highschool. I decided to focus on learning to code in order to start a new career and because its a lot of fun. I know its going to take a lot of hard work and perseverence but I am commited to becoming a programmer so that I can use my new skills to make a better world.
